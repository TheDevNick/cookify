# Cookify
Cookify is a full stack web application that allow users to share different cooking recipes. 

**Link to project:** Comin Soon 



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Cloudinary, multer, passportJS
### This project was created because a client could not find a friendly website that allows people to share, like, comment on other people's recipes. I created this project using the MVC architecture as I think it is the most appropriate for this project. All of the data is being stored in MongoDB Cloud. When logging in user sessions is also being stored in MongoDB. For the front end I am using a templating engine (EJS) to create the initial MVP and will convert to React at a later time. I am also using bootstrap for the initial MVP but will convert to tailwindcss. I am using passportJS for all of the login/signup functionality. All of the backend is created with Node.js and ExpressJS. Some other interesting middleware that I have incorporated is multer and cloudinary for image and file uploading. 

## Optimizations
This application is just a MVP currently so there are a lot of optimizations that I will incorporate. One of the biggest optimization I will add is converting the front end from the ejs templating engine to React. This will make development easier down the road. Another optimization I will add is switching from Bootstrap to tailwindcss. The reason for doing this is that I am already very familiar with Bootstrap and I want to get more familiar with tailwindcss and it seems very cool. 


## Lessons Learned:
I have learned a lot building this project. I have learned the usefulness of using passportJS. It makes authentication so much easier. Another cool thing that I learned was how to use Cloudinary and Multer as middleware for all of my media content uploading functionality.
